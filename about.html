                <div class="about-content">

                    <h2 class="section-title">Introduction</h2>
                    <p>I am <strong>Julius Kirima</strong>, an 18-year-old visionary entrepreneur from Kenya. Growing up in
                        East Africa, I’ve always been surrounded by a community of hardworking people who believe in
                        creating opportunities despite challenges. Watching the struggles and resilience of those around me
                        opened my eyes to how much potential lies within young people, not only in Kenya but across Africa.
                        That perspective shaped the way I think about life, innovation, and the future.</p>
                    <p>My childhood wasn’t filled with luxury or shortcuts — it was filled with curiosity. I constantly
                        asked questions about how things worked, from simple devices in our home to the apps I saw others
                        using on their phones. While many saw these as tools for entertainment, I saw them as opportunities
                        — a window into solving problems that affect millions of people.</p>
                    <p>The more I observed, the clearer it became to me that Africa is not short of talent or creativity;
                        what’s missing is a platform for that creativity to transform into real-world solutions. That
                        realization is what continues to push me every day. I don’t see myself only as a dreamer but as a
                        builder — someone who is willing to start small, learn constantly, and grow into a person who leaves
                        lasting impact.</p>
                    <p>At just 18, I still have much to learn, but I don’t see my age as a limitation. I see it as an
                        advantage. Youth brings energy, new ideas, and the courage to take risks where others hesitate. My
                        journey is still at its beginning, but every step I take is aimed at laying the foundation for
                        something bigger than myself.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-title">My Mission</h2>
                    <p>My mission is simple but deep: to build solutions that empower young people, create opportunities,
                        and inspire innovation across Africa and beyond. I believe that technology should not just entertain
                        or connect — it should also solve problems, open doors, and drive development.</p>
                    <p>For me, this mission is not only about creating apps, platforms, or companies. It’s about creating a
                        movement. A movement where young Africans see themselves as problem-solvers, innovators, and global
                        contributors. I want to help shift the mindset from waiting for opportunities to creating them.</p>
                    <p>This mission also comes from a personal place. I’ve seen how lack of opportunities holds back
                        brilliant minds. I’ve had friends with amazing ideas but no guidance, tools, or support to bring
                        them to life. That is why mentorship, education, and collaboration are so important to me. I don’t
                        just want to succeed individually; I want to bring others along.</p>
                    <p>In the long term, I see myself building ecosystems — spaces where youth can innovate, test ideas, and
                        create scalable solutions. Whether through apps like Vibra, AI-powered tools, or social empowerment
                        platforms, my goal is to design technology that responds to the realities of African lives while
                        still being competitive globally.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-title">Educational Journey</h2>
                    <p>My education has not been the traditional one of sitting in classrooms alone. While school played its
                        role, most of my learning has come from curiosity, self-teaching, and relentless exploration. I’ve
                        spent countless hours online, teaching myself programming languages, understanding how apps are
                        built, and learning how artificial intelligence can be applied to solve real challenges.</p>
                    <p>For me, education is not just about certificates but about skills and mindset. Every day, I challenge
                        myself to learn something new — whether it’s coding, design, entrepreneurship, or leadership. I
                        strongly believe that the world we live in today rewards those who are adaptable and willing to
                        learn fast.</p>
                    <p>Of course, the path has not been easy. There have been times when I felt overwhelmed, especially when
                        facing technical problems without anyone to guide me. But those challenges became my teachers.
                        Struggling through coding errors or design flaws taught me persistence, problem-solving, and
                        patience.</p>
                    <p>Being self-taught also gave me confidence. It proved to me that knowledge is accessible to anyone who
                        is willing to put in the effort. While many young people my age focus on distractions, I chose to
                        focus on building myself. That decision continues to shape my journey, giving me a foundation that
                        will support everything I build in the future.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-title">Rookie CEO Story</h2>
                    <p>Becoming a “rookie CEO” at 18 is not about having a big company or millions in the bank. For me, it’s
                        about taking the first real steps into leadership, vision, and responsibility. I didn’t wait to
                        finish school or to have perfect conditions — I started with what I had: an idea, a laptop, and the
                        courage to try.</p>
                    <p>My first serious attempt at leadership was when I began working on Vibra, a social networking app
                        built for young people. I wanted it to combine the best features of platforms like Facebook, TikTok,
                        and Instagram, while also addressing unique local needs such as empowerment, jobs, and youth
                        opportunities. The process was far from smooth — I had to learn, fail, and adjust quickly.</p>
                    <p>Calling myself a CEO at this stage is not about ego. It’s about mindset. It’s about training myself
                        to think beyond just coding an app, but to think about users, growth, impact, and sustainability.
                        Every choice I make today is preparing me for the bigger challenges of running a real, scalable
                        company tomorrow.</p>
                    <p>Being a rookie CEO also means facing doubt — from others and sometimes even from myself. But I remind
                        myself that every great founder started as a beginner. Every billion-dollar company started as an
                        idea in someone’s head. I might be at the beginning of my story, but I believe strongly in where I
                        am headed.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-title">Company Background</h2>

                    <p>My first company is still in its early stages, but its purpose is clear: to design and build
                        technology that empowers. The initial focus is on Vibra, my flagship app project. Vibra is more than
                        just a social platform; it is being built as a space for young people to connect, create, earn, and
                        grow.</p>
                    <p>What sets my company apart is not size but vision. We are not trying to copy what exists — we’re
                        trying to create something new, something that belongs to Africa while still being global. From
                        AI-powered features to opportunities for creators and job-seekers, the company is being shaped to
                        reflect the real needs of the people who will use it.</p>
                    <p>The early journey has been about planning, learning, and building step by step. With limited
                        resources, I have had to be creative — using no-code tools (and at the same time learning coding), testing features, and seeking guidance
                        from mentors whenever possible. The goal is to validate the vision, grow steadily, and eventually
                        scale to a level where Vibra and other solutions can compete internationally.</p>
                    <p>My company background is still being written. It’s not yet about revenue charts or global offices —
                        it’s about planting seeds. The seeds of ideas that can grow into powerful platforms. The seeds of
                        resilience that will allow me to overcome challenges. And the seeds of ambition that keep me
                        grounded in my mission. </p>



                    <h2 class="section-title">Closing Inspiration</h2>
                    <p>My journey is just beginning, but my vision is clear: Africa’s youth are the architects of the
                        future. I believe in a generation that does not wait for change but creates it. Every challenge we
                        face is an opportunity to innovate, and every step forward is proof that dreams are valid.</p>
